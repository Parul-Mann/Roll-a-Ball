-Custom C# scripts written to create the game functionality.
-User interface added to improve the game experience.


## Working:
-The player will control a ball rolling around the game board using physics.
-The game uses player input from the keyboard to apply forces to the ball and move it around the game environment. 
-The ball will detect contact between the ball and other objects in the game so they can be collected.
-The objective of the game is to collect all the objects using the ball. When the player has collected all the objects, they win.  


## Functions: 
- Ball rolling set up according to physics.
- Input System in Unity used to take user input with the arrow keys.
- Detection of collisions between ball and objects.
- Audios on collision, winning and background. 
- Target count set up by counting the number of collisions between the ball and target objects.
